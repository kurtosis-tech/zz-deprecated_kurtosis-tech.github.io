Advanced Usage
==============

Network Partitioning
--------------------
Kurtosis allows you to write tests that simulate network partitions between different nodes of your network. To use this functionality:

1. Set the `IsPartitioningEnabled` flag to `true` in your `TestConfiguration` object that your test returns
1. Call the `repartition` method on the `NetworkContext` object to divide the network into multiple partitions, configuring the access between the partitions (blocked or not)

This will set the desired network states between the various partitions, simulating a partitioned network. When adding services to the partitioned network, make sure to use `NetworkContext.addServiceToPartition` rather than `addService`, because the latter uses the default partition which will no longer exist after repartitioning.

Mounting External Files
-----------------------
External files can be mounted inside a Docker container running inside a Kurtosis test, so long as the files are packaged inside a GZ-compressed TAR file and hosted at a URL accessible by your CI. To use this functionality:

1. Declare the URLs of the artifacts that your test will need in its `TestConfiguration` object, mapped to IDs that you'll use to identify the artifacts
1. When building the `ContainerCreationConfig` inside your `ContainerConfigFactory`, use the `withFilesArtifacts` function of the builder to declare where to mount the files inside the artifacts
