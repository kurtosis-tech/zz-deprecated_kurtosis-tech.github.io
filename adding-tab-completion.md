Adding Tab Completion
=====================
[The Kurtosis CLI](./using-the-cli.md) supports tab completion for `bash`, `zsh`, and `fish` via the `kurtosis completion SHELL` command (e.g. `kurtosis completion bash`). `source`ing the output of the command will enable tab-completion, and adding the `source` command to your shell config file will enable it across shells. The instructions below will get you set up for your shell.

**NOTE:** As of 2022-02-21, tab completion for all commands is available but intelligent tab completion for command parameters (e.g. `kurtosis enclave inspect <TAB>` auto-completing enclave IDs) is still ongoing.


Bash
----
1. Ensure you have Bash version >= 4.1
    1. Print your Bash version:
        ```bash
        echo $BASH_VERSION
        ```
    1. If your Bash version is less than 4.1, upgrade it:
        * On Mac, upgrade Mac via Homebrew:
            ```bash
            brew install bash
            ```
        * On Linux, [upgrade it via the package manager for your distro](https://www.configserverfirewall.com/linux-tutorials/update-bash-linux/)
1. Check if you have [bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion) installed:
    ```bash
    type _init_completion
    ```
1. If you get an error like `-bash: type: _init_completion: not found`, install Bash completion:
    * On Mac:
        1. Install the completion library:
            ```bash
            brew install bash-completion@2
            ```
        1. Add the following to your `~/.bash_profile`:
            ```bash
            export BASH_COMPLETION_COMPAT_DIR="/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d"
            [[ -r "/usr/local/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh" ]] && . "/usr/local/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh"
            ```
        1. Reload your shell
        1. Verify that you now have the completion installed:
            ```bash
            type _init_completion
            ```
    * On Linux, install it using the package manager for your distro using [these installation instructions](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion#installation)
1. Source the output of `kurtosis completion bash` in your Bash config file:
    * On Mac, add the following to your `~/.bash_profile` file:
        ```bash
        # Add Kurtosis tab-completion
        source <(kurtosis completion bash)
        ```
    * On Linux, add the following to your `~/.bashrc` file:
        ```bash
        # Add Kurtosis tab-completion
        source <(kurtosis completion bash)
        ```
1. If you have an alias set up for Kurtosis, add completion for that as well (we'll assume the alias `kt` in the examples below):
    * On Mac, add the following to your `~/.bash_profile` file:
        ```bash
        # Add tab-completion to Kurtosis alias
        complete -F __start_kurtosis kt
        ```
    * On Linux, add the following to your `~/.bashrc` file:
        ```bash
        # Add tab-completion to Kurtosis alias
        complete -F __start_kurtosis kt
        ```
1. Reload your shell

Zsh
---
1. Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` file:
    ```zsh
    # Add Kurtosis tab-completion
    source <(kurtosis completion zsh)
    ```
1. If you have an alias set up for Kurtosis, add the following to your `~/.zshrc` file (we'll assume the alias `kt` in this example):
    ```zsh
    # Add tab-completion to Kurtosis alias
    compdef __start_kurtosis kt
    ```
1. Reload your shell
1. If you get an error like `complete:13: command not found: compdef`, add the following to the top of your `~/.zshrc` and reload your shell again:
    ```zsh
    autoload -Uz compinit
    compinit
    ```

Fish
----
1. Add the following to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file:
    ```fish
    # Add Kurtosis tab-completion
    kurtosis completion fish | source
    ```
1. Reload your shell
